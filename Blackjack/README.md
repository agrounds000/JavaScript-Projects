## How to play Blackjack

Blackjack is a card game that uses a standard deck of 52 cards. The goal of the game is to get a score as close to 21 as possible without going over 21.
The number on each card drawen indicates the score that will be added to that player. The Jack, Queen, and King all give a score of 10,
Aces give a score of either 1 or 11, whichever is more beneficial for the player.

Pree the Hit button to draw more cards and press Stand when you are done.

I do plan to rewrite this project later on to feature some of the newer ECMAScript features. As always, please let me know if you have any suggestions for code improvements or ideas for future projects.
